                        </h2>
                        <p>We take the security of your personal data seriously and have implemented technical and organizational measures to protect your personal data from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. We use industry-standard encryption technology to protect your personal data during transmission and storage.</p>
                        <p>However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal data. We encourage users to take steps to reduce the risk of fraud and to help protect the confidentiality and security of their NEECO II-AREA1 Online account and personal information, including but not limited to the following:</p>
                        <ul class="list-custom">
                            <li>Use strong passwords: A strong password should be at least 8 characters long, and contain a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using common words or phrases, as they can be easily guessed.</li>
                            <li>Limit your personal information: Avoid sharing personal information on social media or other public forums, as this can make it easier for hackers to guess your security questions.</li>
                            <li>Use different passwords for each account: This way, if one account is compromised, your other accounts will still be secure.</li>
                            <li>Create strong usernames and passwords with 15 or more characters using both upper- and lower-case letters, numbers and special characters.</li>
                            <li>Be cautious of phishing scams: Phishing scams are attempts to trick you into revealing sensitive information by posing as a trustworthy source. Be wary of unsolicited emails or messages that ask for your login information or personal details.</li>
                            <li>Update your contact information when it changes so you can be contacted if there's a problem.</li>
