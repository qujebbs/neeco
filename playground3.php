                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                    <li>•	Use strong passwords: A strong password should be at least 8 characters long, and contain a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using common words or phrases, as they can be easily guessed.</li>
                    <li>•	Limit your personal information: Avoid sharing personal information on social media or other public forums, as this can make it easier for hackers to guess your security questions.</li>
                    <li>•	Use different passwords for each account: This way, if one account is compromised, your other accounts will still be secure.</li>
                    <li>•	Create strong usernames and passwords with 15 or more characters using both upper- and lower-case letters, numbers and special characters</li>
                    <li>•	Be cautious of phishing scams: Phishing scams are attempts to trick you into revealing sensitive information by posing as a trustworthy source. Be wary of unsolicited emails or messages that ask for your login information or personal details.</li>
                    <li>•	Update your contact information when it changes so you can be contacted if there’s a problem</li>
